    "# Arrays: Sliding Window Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is the Sliding Window Technique?\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you have a long array (or a string), and you want to look at a \"segment\" or \"subarray\" of it. Instead of looking at every single possible segment independently (which would be very inefficient), you create a \"window\" that slides over the array.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of it like a physical window (a frame) moving across a landscape. The window has a certain size (fixed or variable), and as it moves, you process the elements currently \"inside\" that window.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Window:** A contiguous (unbroken) sub-array or sub-string.\n",
    "* **Sliding:** The window moves from one end of the array to the other, usually by extending one end (right pointer) and shrinking from the other end (left pointer).\n",
    "\n",
    "## When Do You Use It?\n",
    "\n",
    "The Sliding Window technique is primarily used for problems that ask for:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The **maximum/minimum sum**, average, or some other property of a **contiguous sub-array or sub-string** of a certain size.\n",
    "* The **smallest/largest sub-array/sub-string** that satisfies a given condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's most effective when you need to perform calculations on **all possible contiguous sub-arrays/sub-strings**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why is it Efficient?\n",
    "\n",
    "Without a sliding window, many of these problems would require nested loops. For example, to find the maximum sum of all subarrays of size `K`:\n",
    "* Outer loop: Iterates from the start of the array to `N-K`.\n",
    "* Inner loop: Calculates the sum of `K` elements.\n",
    "This would lead to an **O(N*K)** or often **O(N^2)** time complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Sliding Window technique reduces this to **O(N)** (linear time complexity). How? Because you only iterate through the array *once* with your pointers. When the window slides, you typically just add the new element entering the window and subtract the old element leaving the window, instead of re-calculating the sum (or other property) of the entire window from scratch.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to Implement It (General Pattern):\n",
    "\n",
    "You typically use **two pointers**:\n",
    "* `left` (or `start`): Marks the beginning of your window.\n",
    "* `right` (or `end`): Marks the end of your window.\n",
    "\n",
    "The general steps are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Initialize:**\n",
    "    * Set `left = 0`.\n",
    "    * Set `current_window_sum` (or count, or whatever property you're tracking) to 0.\n",
    "    * Initialize `max_result` (or `min_result`, depending on the problem) to an appropriate initial value (e.g., negative infinity for max sum, positive infinity for min length).\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Expand the Window:**\n",
    "    * Iterate with the `right` pointer from `0` to `len(array) - 1`.\n",
    "    * As `right` moves, add the element `array[right]` to your `current_window_sum` (or update your count/property).\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Check Window Size / Condition:**\n",
    "    * **Fixed-size window:** If your window size (`right - left + 1`) is equal to the target size `K`:\n",
    "        * Update your `max_result` (or `min_result`) with the `current_window_sum`.\n",
    "        * **Shrink the window:** Subtract `array[left]` from `current_window_sum`.\n",
    "        * Move `left` pointer one step to the right (`left += 1`).\n",
    "    * **Variable-size window:** If your `current_window_sum` (or some other condition) meets the problem's criteria, you might need to shrink the window from the left (`while current_window_sum >= target:`) until the condition is no longer met, updating results along the way. (This is more advanced, we'll stick to fixed for now).\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Return Result:** After the `right` pointer reaches the end of the array, return your `max_result` (or `min_result`).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n"

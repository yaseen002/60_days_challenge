    "\n",
    "- **Contiguous memory locations:** This is the most important characteristic. It means that when you create an array, the computer allocates a single, unbroken block of memory to store all its elements one after another. Think of it like all those mailboxes being right next to each other on the same street.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Fixed size (often):** In many traditional programming languages (like C++, Java, or even Python lists which are dynamic, but the underlying array can be seen as fixed chunks), arrays are often fixed in size once they are created. This means you specify how many elements it can hold at the time of creation, and you can't easily change that size later without creating a new array. (Python's built-in list is a dynamic array, but the concept of a fundamental array is often fixed-size).\n",

    "- **Indexed:** Each element in an array is identified by a unique number called an index. In most programming languages, array indices start from 0. So, if an array has 5 elements, their indices will be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4."
